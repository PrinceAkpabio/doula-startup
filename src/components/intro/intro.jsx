          So you want to dive into birth work? Congratulations! Answering the call to become a Doula means facing decisions that have to be made all at once.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may be asking yourself, what is the first step? How do I know Doula work is right for me?  Am I ready to be a doula? Can I support families in my community? Is there a place I can go for mentorship and support?</p><br></br>  <p>I have asked myself all the same questions plus so many more as I have started down the path towards my dream of making my passion for supporting others in maternal health my full-time career.</p> <br></br>
          <p>The goods news is you are in the right place!</p>
